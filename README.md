# go-morse
Simple morse-to-text and text-to-morse converter.

## Usage:
- `go build morseChat.go` (Not needed if you are on mac. Use the `binary` file already present)
- `./morseChat <code/text>` where `<code/text>` can contain morse code as well as text. Input will be converted to the other format.

## Note:
I built it as a small fun project to chat with my [brother](https://github.com/xxihawkxx), so it made sense for me to also copy the converted Morse Code to clipboard for ease of use.
This might not suit everybody :)
